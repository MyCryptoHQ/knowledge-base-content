If there's a feature that you think would make MyCrypto a better product, we
want to know. Here's the best way to tell us:

1. **Search for your suggestion** - If you've thought of a good new feature,
   chances are someone else may have too. To consolidate issues, we'll keep
   feature requests in one thread. Show your support for a request by using
   the thumbs up response on the GitHub issue.

2. **Describe your suggestion** - Describe in detail how you would want this
   new feature to work. If something doesn't work very well, it helps to know
   the pain points. If you have an idea of how to make it better, feel free to
   suggest!

3. **Provide examples** - If it's something another website or app is doing,
   shoot us a link or a screenshot. We build better projects by working with
   other developers in our community.

Features that are requested with the above information have a better chance of
getting implemented. Thanks for the suggestions!
