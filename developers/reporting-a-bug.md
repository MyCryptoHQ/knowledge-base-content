## Reporting a Bug

If you've found a bug, or something confusing about MyCrypto, here's what you
should do:

1. **Search for your issue** - If you're experiencing something, the chances are
    good that someone else is too. Search the issue queue or our
    [Knowledge Base](https://support.mycrypto.com/) before posting. You may even find an
    answer to your problem!
2. **Describe the issue in detail** - Instead of describing something as "not
    working" or being "broken," explain what you expected to happen, and what's
    happening instead or just not happening.
3. **Provide console logs** - Every browser has the ability to view logs from
    Javascript, which is where many error messages will get displayed if
    there's a bug in the code. Here's how in [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Console),
    [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/),
    [Internet Explorer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn255006(v=vs.85).aspx),
    [Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide/console),
    and [Safari](https://www.wickedlysmart.com/hfjsconsole/). You'll want to
    provide us with as many of the logs as possible, especially anything in red.
4. **Provide browser information** - Let us know what operating system, browser,
    browser version, and mobile device (if applicable) the problem is occurring on. This will help us debug
    your issue on an identical device.

Following the above steps will ensure that your bug is addressed in a timely and
efficient manner. Thanks for keeping MyCrypto bug free!
