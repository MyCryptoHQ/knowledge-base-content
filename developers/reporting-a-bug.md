If you've found a bug, or something confusing about MyCrypto, here's what you
should do:

1. **Search for your issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/issues)** - If you're experiencing something, the chances are good that someone else is too. You may even find an answer to your problem!
2. **Describe the issue in detail** - Instead of describing something as "not working" or being "broken," explain what you expected to happen, and what's happening instead or just not happening.
3. **Provide console logs** - Every browser has the ability to view logs from Javascript, which is where many error messages will get displayed if there's a bug in the code. Here's how in [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Console), [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/), [Internet Explorer](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn255006(v=vs.85).aspx>), [Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide/console) and [Safari](https://www.wickedlysmart.com/hfjsconsole/). Please provide us with as many of the logs as possible, especially anything in red.
4. **Provide browser information** - Let us know what operating system, browser, browser version, and mobile device (if applicable) the problem is occurring on. This will help us debug your issue on an identical device.

Following the above steps will ensure that your bug is addressed in a timely and
efficient manner.

If there is no existing GitHub issue for your bug report yet, feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/issues/new), or reach out to us through [the contact form](/contact-us).

Thanks for keeping MyCrypto bug free!
