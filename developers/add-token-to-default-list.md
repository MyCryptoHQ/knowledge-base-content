[If you are experimenting with tokens, you can add a token to your local version of MyCrypto.](/how-to/tokens/showing-and-loading-tokens)

MyCrypto ships with a default token list that allows our Token Scanner functionality to check balances for a pre-determined set of tokens, which is displayed to the user.

If a token is a not in the list, users are still able to add their desired token manually through our Custom Token functionality.

If your token is not yet included on our default token list, you can add it at <https://github.com/ethereum-lists/tokens>, which is synced with the MyCrypto codebase before each release.

We ask that you do not PR the token directly to our default token list at <https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/blob/develop/common/config/tokens/eth.json>, as we have an automated script that pulls from <https://github.com/ethereum-lists/tokens> instead.
