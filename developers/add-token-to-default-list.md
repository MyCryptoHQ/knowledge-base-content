[If you are experimenting with tokens, you can add a token to your local version of MyCrypto.](/how-to/tokens/showing-and-loading-tokens)

MyCrypto ships with a default token list that allows our Token Scanner functionality to check balances for a pre-determined set of tokens, which is displayed to the user.

If a token is a not in the list, users are still able to add their desired token manually through our Custom Token functionality.

If your token is not yet included on our default token list, you can add it at <https://github.com/ethereum-lists/tokens>. Once your token is on `ethereum-lists/tokens`, it will automatically be added to MyCrypto, usually within 12 hours.

If you want to add price data for your token, either reach out to us through [Telegram](https://t.me/mycryptohq) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/VSaTXEA), or add your token price information to [our assets repository](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/assets/blob/master/assets/assets.json).
