## Overview

This document is meant to allow hackers to skip the recon stage and get straight into trying to find vulnerabilities. It outlines the in-scope domains, the software behind them, and a brief description of their functions.

Our responsible disclosure program policy can be found at - [https://security.mycrypto.com](https://security.mycrypto.com).

<!-- Domain: *.mycrypto -->

### [(www.)mycrypto.com](https://mycrypto.com)

#### What it does

This is the domain for our main application - the interface for the blockchain. This is where users will come to interact with their funds, and sign transactions with private keys.

#### What to look for

Since the platform is non-custodial (meaning we don't store users' keys), we are especially interested in how a bad actor could exploit potential attack vectors to steal user funds/keys.

The application is open-source on GitHub: <https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto>.

#### What it runs on

The domain itself points to an AWS instance and is delivered using CloudFront.

It is built with Typescript and Javascript (React framework).

<https://builtwith.com/mycrypto.com>

![separator](../assets/general-knowledge/about-mycrypto/system-mapping/separator.png)

### [buy.mycrypto.com](https://buy.mycrypto.com)

#### What it does

This is an application that uses Simplex to enable users to purchase ETH and BTC with a credit card. The purchasing process is handled by Simplex but the UI is hosted by MyCrypto.

#### What to look for

The application is a simple UI form that redirects the user to Simplex. We are interested in ways the application can be exploited to redirect users away from Simplex. Since it is stateless, your best bet is reflected XSS (type II) or DOM-based XSS (type-0).

The application is open-source on GitHub: <https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/buy.mycrypto.com>.

#### What it runs on

The application is delivered via Cloudflare and runs on an Express server.

It is built with Javascript.

<https://builtwith.com/buy.mycrypto.com>

![separator](../assets/general-knowledge/about-mycrypto/system-mapping/separator.png)

### [support.mycrypto.com](https://support.mycrypto.com)

#### What it does

This is our knowledge base, which contains a lot of articles that we point users to when they are in need of support. It is viewed as a trusted source of truth for users.

#### What to look for

As the application is viewed as a trusted source of truth, we are interested in ways a bad actor could modify the contents of an article to misinform users or otherwise use the platform to give false information.

The application is open-source on GitHub: <https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/knowledge-base>.

#### What it runs on

The application is delivered via GitHub pages.

It is built with Typescript and Javascript (Gatsby framework).

<https://builtwith.com/support.mycrypto.com>

![separator](../assets/general-knowledge/about-mycrypto/system-mapping/separator.png)

### [overflow.mycrypto.com](https://overflow.mycrypto.com)

#### What it does

This is a product page for some of our peripheral systems/applications that we use within our main product ([mycrypto.com](https://mycrypto.com)). 

#### What to look for

The application is essentially a directory for some of the other products we manage. Your route is reflected XSS (type II) or DOM-based XSS (type-0). 

The application is open-source on GitHub: <https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/Overflow>.

#### What it runs on

The application is delivered via GitHub pages.

It is built with Typescript and Javascript (React framework).

### [about.mycrypto.com](https://about.mycrypto.com)

#### What it does

An application detailing who is on the team and any job opening we have available.

#### What to look for

The application is essentially a directory of jobs and people who work for MyCrypto. Links to dead off-domain profiles that can be harnessed to give false information to users is one attack vector that we are interested in.

The application is open-source on GitHub: <https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/about.mycrypto.com>.

#### What it runs on

The application is delivered via GitHub pages and cached behind Cloudfront.

It is built with Javascript.

<https://builtwith.com/about.mycrypto.com>

![separator](../assets/general-knowledge/about-mycrypto/system-mapping/separator.png)

### [beta.mycrypto.com](https://beta.mycrypto.com)

#### What it does

This sub-domain for our main application is our public staging area for all new features that will go into production after the development cycle is completed.

#### What to look for

Since the platform is non-custodial (meaning we don't store users keys), we are especially interested in how a bad actor could exploit potential attack vectors to steal user funds/keys (such as altering a transaction to sign).

The application is open-source on GitHub: <https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto>.

#### What it runs on

The application is delivered via GitHub pages.

It is built with Typescript and Javascript (React framework).

<https://builtwith.com/beta.mycrypto.com>

![separator](../assets/general-knowledge/about-mycrypto/system-mapping/separator.png)

### [download.mycrypto.com](https://download.mycrypto.com)

#### What it does

This application offers a download (Electron app) of our main product ([mycrypto.com](https://mycrypto.com)) for users to run offline. There are alow tools available also on the site that can be used to verify download checksums.

#### What to look for

As the downloaded application is utilized for signing transactions, we are interested in invalid signed checksums being published/spoofed or any methods that can be used to circumvent the legitimate application from being downloaded.

The application is open-source on GitHub: <https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/download.mycrypto.com>.

The downloaded application is generated with Electron based on our main repo <https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto>
