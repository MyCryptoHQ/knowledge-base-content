## Use our tool...

* More easily debug, generate, reveal, and finalize data: [https://legacy.mycrypto.com/helpers.html](https://legacy.mycrypto.com/helpers.html)

## Get the transaction ID of your original bid

Under "input data" it should look like:

`Function: newBid(bytes32 sealedBid) MethodID: 0xce92dced[0]:69faf18dd0953d9124d7917234b0efc05c78fd0d9abfc6ffb32d512680fdbb65`

## Get the information that will match your bid via [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6090a6e47849629b7245dfa1ca21d94cd15878ef#readContract)

Under shaBid:

* First is the sha3 hash of the name *(with 0x before it)*
* Then your address *(with 0x before it)*
* Then the value of your bid in wei
* Then your hash of your secret *(with 0x before it)*

You need whatever it outputs when you hit "query" to match the string in your original bid.

## Once you have that, construct the data string:

1. Always the same (`0x47872b42`)
2. Hash of name you bid on, without 0x
3. Always the same (`0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`)
4. Value of your bid in wei...in hex
5. The sha3 of your secret from the long string, without 0x

### Example

1. `0x47872b42`
2. [NAME YOU BID ON HASH]
3. `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
4. [VALUE HEX]
5. [SECRET HASH]

Before moving forward, count the number of characters in #4 (usually 14 or 15) and delete that many 0's from #3.

Next, combine that string into one long string and use that as the data field:

1. Go to [https://mycrypto.com/account](https://mycrypto.com/account)
2. Send to: `0x6090a6e47849629b7245dfa1ca21d94cd15878ef`
3. Amount: `0`
4. Data: `0x47872b42[NAME YOU BID ON HASH]0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000[VALUE HEX][SECRET HASH]`
5. Gas limit: `200000`

### Example

* There is a bid here for mewtopia.eth: [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1c741eb4fe698d5429027fdd6a9d7d87638f27ae0663b43e1f06ef141270dc0f)

* It has the bidhash of `69faf18dd0953d9124d7917234b0efc05c78fd0d9abfc6ffb32d512680fdbb65`

* I know that I bid:
  * `mewtopia`
  * `0.01 ETH`
  * `exact depend exhibit`

#### Then I turn that into

* (`0x7cb57b5a97eabe94205c07890be4c1ad31e486a8`)
* `0x07aa9c7e03a795d250a2ac48bd73b9c7f8adab69a549cebd97fc157a093a5a4a`
* `10000000000000000`
* `0x00d70f3b7e512382c3b5e27dd15df51c68c0a18528a604792ff20890eec20a31`

I check it on <https://etherscan.io/address/0x6090a6e47849629b7245dfa1ca21d94cd15878ef#readContract> and make sure the sealedBid output is the same as my bidhash.

#### Then I turn that into

* `0x47872b42`
* `07aa9c7e03a795d250a2ac48bd73b9c7f8adab69a549cebd97fc157a093a5a4a`
* `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
* `2386f26fc10000`
* `00d70f3b7e512382c3b5e27dd15df51c68c0a18528a604792ff20890eec20a31`

#### Then I turn that into

* `0x47872b42`
* `07aa9c7e03a795d250a2ac48bd73b9c7f8adab69a549cebd97fc157a093a5a4a`
* `00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
* `2386f26fc10000`
* `00d70f3b7e512382c3b5e27dd15df51c68c0a18528a604792ff20890eec20a31`

#### Then I turn that into

* `0x47872b4207aa9c7e03a795d250a2ac48bd73b9c7f8adab69a549cebd97fc157a093a5a4a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002386f26fc1000000d70f3b7e512382c3b5e27dd15df51c68c0a18528a604792ff20890eec20a31`

And I use this string as the data field in my transaction to reveal my bid for that name.
