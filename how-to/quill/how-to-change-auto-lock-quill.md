When your Quill interface was left unattended for a certain period of time, Quill's Auto-Lock Timer automatically locks your interface, keeping your funds safe and secure.

By default, Quill will automatically lock after 5 minutes of inactivity.

## Changing the Timer

Open up Quill, and unlock it by entering your Quill password.

By default, Quill's Auto-Lock Timer is set to 5 minutes. You can select either a longer or shorter inactivity duration. After selecting your new inactivity duration, it'll automatically be saved in your Quill settings.

If you use a shared computer, we highly recommend keeping your Auto-Lock Timer at a low inactivity duration, and to lock your Quill interface immediately after use.
