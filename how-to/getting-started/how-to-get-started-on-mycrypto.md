* Please take some time to understand this for your own security.
* Your may run the risk of losing your funds if you do not fully understand the warnings listed below.

## What is MyCrypto?

* MyCrypto is a free, open-source, client-side interface.
* We allow you to interact directly with the blockchain while remaining in full control of your keys & your funds.
* You and only you are responsible for your security.
* We cannot recover your funds or freeze your account if you visit a phishing site or lose your private key.

## MyCrypto is not a bank

* When you open an account with a bank or exchange, they create an account for you in their system.
* The bank keeps track of your personal information, account passwords, balances, transactions and ultimately your money.
* The bank charge fees to manage your account and provide services, like refunding transactions when your card gets stolen.
* The bank allows you to write a check or charge your debit card to send money, go online to check your balance, reset your password, and get a new debit card if you lose it.
* You have an account with the bank or exchange and they decide how much money you can send, where you can send it, and how long to hold on a suspicious deposit. All for a fee.

## MyCrypto is an interface

* When you create an account on MyCrypto you are generating a cryptographic set of numbers: your private key and your public key (address).
* The handling of your keys happens entirely on your computer, inside your browser.
* We never transmit, receive or store your private key, password, or other account information.
* We do not charge a transaction fee.
* You are simply using our interface to interact directly with the blockchain.
* If you send your public key (address) to someone, they can send you ETH or tokens.
* If you send your private key to someone, they now have full control of your account.

## Wait, what is a blockchain?

* The blockchain is a digital decentralized ledger.
* It keeps track of all transactions in a chronological order that have ever been made in the history of the blockchain.
* It is stored and maintained by a peer-to-peer network made up of nodes (mienrs) which verify and approve of transactions, which make it nearly impossible to fake or tamper with transactions.
* The blocks in the blockchain are made up of a group of transactions that have been verified and accepted by the miners. This "block" is then added to the stack of previous blocks, which forms a chain of blocks: a.k.a The BlockChain.
* When you see your balance on MyCrypto.com or view your transactions on etherscan.io, you are seeing data on the blockchain, MyCrypto does *NOT* store any data.
* We are not the blockchain, we allow you to interact *WITH* the Ethereum blockchain (send transactions), and view information that is publicly available on the blockchain

## We need you to understand that we **cannot**...

* Access your account or send your funds for you.
* Recover or change your private key.
* Recover or reset your password.
* Reverse, cancel, or refund transactions.
* Freeze accounts.
* We do not store any of your information, so we can not access any information besides what is publicly available on the blockchain.

<Clearfix />

## **You** and **only you** are responsible for your security

* Be diligent to keep your private key and password safe. Your private key is sometimes called your mnemonic phrase, keystore file, UTC file, JSON file, wallet file.
* If lose your private key or password, no one can recover it.
* If you enter your private key on a phishing website, you will have all your funds taken.

## If MyCrypto can't do those things, what's the point?

* Because that is the point of decentralization and the blockchain.
* You don't have to rely on your bank, government, or anyone else when you want to move your funds.
* You don't have to rely on the security of an exchange or bank to keep your funds safe.
* If you don't find these things valuable, ask yourself why you think the blockchain and cryptocurrencies are valuable. 😉
* If you don't like the sound of this, consider using [Coinbase](https://coinbase-consumer.sjv.io/RVmkN) or [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/signup). They have more familiar accounts with usernames & passwords.
* If you are scared but want to use MyCrypto, [get a hardware wallet](/staying-safe/hardware-wallet-recommendations)! These keep your keys secure.

## How to protect yourself from phishers

Phishers send you a message with a link to a website that looks just like MyCrypto, EtherDelta, Paypal, or your bank, but is not the real website. They steal your information and then steal your money.

* Use the [ESL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ethersecuritylookup/bhhfhgpgmifehjdghlbbijjaimhmcgnf?hl=en-GB) or [MetaMask](/how-to/migrating/moving-from-mycrypto-to-metamask) Chrome Extension to block malicious websites.
* Always check the URL: `https://mycrypto.com`.
* Always make sure the URL bar has `MyCrypto, Inc` in green.
* Do not trust messages or links sent to you randomly via email, Slack, Reddit, Twitter, etc.
* Always navigate directly to a site before you enter information. Do not enter information after clicking a link from a message or email.
* [Install an AdBlocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) and do not click ads on your search engine (e.g. Google).

## How to protect yourself from scams

* If it is too good to be true, it probably is.
* Research before sending money to someone or some project. Look for information on a variety of websites and forums. Be wary.
* Ask questions when you don't understand something or it doesn't seem right.
* Don't let fear, FUD, or FOMO win over common sense. If something is very urgent, ask yourself "why?". It may be to create FOMO or prevent you from doing research.

## How to protect yourself from loss

If you lose your private key or password, it is gone forever. Don't lose it.

* Make a backup of your private key and password. Do NOT just store it on your computer. Print it out on a piece of paper or save it to a USB drive.
* Store this paper or USB drive in a different physical location. A backup is not useful if it is destroyed by a fire or flood along with your laptop.
* Do not store your private key in Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud storage. If that account is compromised, your funds will be stolen.
* If you have more than 1-week's worth of pay worth of cryptocurrency, get a hardware wallet. No excuses. It's worth it. I promise.
