With Ethereum, signatures are a way of providing evidence that a specific user has access to a specific address.

For example, if user A wants to provide evidence to user B that user A has access to address X, they could sign a message with their private key, stating that user A has access to address X, then share the signed signature with user B. If the signature is correct, user B can verify that user A has access to address X without user A ever having to share their private key to user B.

### Signing a message

1. Go to the [message signing page on MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/sign-and-verify-message/sign).
2. Access your wallet.

4. Click the big blue "Sign Message" button.
5. Your signed message will appear in a box below. It should look a bit like this:

```json
{
  "address": "0x497D15829C338f9e817314662febC7ccE47E69b1",
  "msg": "This is proof that I, user A, have access to this address.",
  "sig": "0xfa076d068ca83ec87203f394c630a1a992f0d39eac5e761aec4c90011204f0b776adf698fe3d626dfd4e7c6ef1f89adb4b9831adaeac72dd19093381265b45471b",
  "version": "2"
}
```

You can use this message as proof that you own an address, and share it with anyone.

### Verifying a message

1. Go to the [message verifying page on MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/sign-and-verify-message/verify).
2. Enter the signed message that you want to check, and click "Verify Message."

If the signature is correct, a green bar will be displayed.
