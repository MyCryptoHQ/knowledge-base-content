The amount of testnet Ether you can request in a day is limited based on the demand. If you need a higher amount of testnet Ether, please reach out to us through [the contact form](/contact-us), or send an email to support@mycrypto.com. Please include the testnet, the amount you would like, and your Ethereum address. Although we will try to honor every request, please keep in mind that we only have a limited amount of testnet Ether at any given time. Usually, building and testing applications on testnet only requires up to 5 ETH. If you would like to request a higher amount because of exceptional circumstances (like education or non-profit development), include a clear explanation of your use case.
