Here is a list of reputable services you can use to buy and sell ETH / Tokens / fiat (USD, EUR, etc.). There are many, many more out there but these are the ones we are familar with.

**Pro Tip**: Always google "`brand name` scam" and read about people's experiences before choosing to send to a random service or website.

Not all exchanges support all coin types and fiat types, so take a look around to find one that fits your location and circumstances.
