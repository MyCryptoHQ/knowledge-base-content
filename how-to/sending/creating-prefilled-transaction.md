Pre-filled transactions can be created by appending certain parameters into the query section of a URL.

### Currently supported parameters

* `to` - The *To* address of the transaction.
* `value` - The *Value* of the transaction (in Ether).
* `data` - The *Data* field of the transaction (should be in hex format).

An example:

<https://mycrypto.com/account/send?&to=0x4bbeEB066eD09B7AEd07bF39EEe0460DFa261520&value=1&data=0xadefadedafdef>

Breaking this down, the transaction will have:

* A send *To* address = `0x4bbeEB066eD09B7AEd07bF39EEe0460DFa261520`.
* A *Value* = `1` Ether.
* A *Data* field = `0xadefadedafdef`.

After accessing your wallet, this will open with the prefilled transaction screen:

## Final notes

* We only support the parameters listed above. 
* We do not support setting a *gas price*, *gas limit* or *nonce* because we auto-calculate those fields.
* We do not currently support the *tokenSymbol* and *sendMode* token parameters. We may add this in the future.
