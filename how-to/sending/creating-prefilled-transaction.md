Pre-filled transactions can be created by appending certain parameters into the query section of a URL.

### Currently supported parameters

- `to` - The _To_ address of the transaction.
- `value` - The _Value_ of the transaction (in Ether).
- `data` - The _Data_ field of the transaction (should be in hex format).

An example:

<https://mycrypto.com/account/send?&to=0x4bbeEB066eD09B7AEd07bF39EEe0460DFa261520&value=1&data=0xadefadedafdef>

Breaking this down, the transaction will have:

- A send _To_ address = `0x4bbeEB066eD09B7AEd07bF39EEe0460DFa261520`.
- A _Value_ = `1` Ether.
- A _Data_ field = `0xadefadedafdef`.

After accessing your wallet, this will open with the prefilled transaction screen:

## Final notes

- We only support the parameters listed above.
- We do not support setting a _gas price_, _gas limit_ or _nonce_ because we auto-calculate those fields.
- We do not currently support the _tokenSymbol_ and _sendMode_ token parameters. We may add this in the future.
