Storing your ETH, tokens, ETC, BTC and many other cryptocurrencies on a [hardware wallet](/staying-safe/hardware-wallet-recommendations) like the Ledger wallet is one of the safest and easiest ways to store your coins. Though the keys are stored on the device itself, you can increase your security by accessing your Ledger wallet offline. This reduces various risks, like [phishing attacks](/staying-safe/common-scams/common-scams-overview).

## Downloading the MyCrypto desktop application

To be able to run MyCrypto offline, you will have to install the latest version of the MyCrypto desktop application. This will allow you to access your Ledger device locally, both online and offline. You can find our guide on downloading & running MyCrypto locally [here](/how-to/offline/how-to-run-mycrypto-offline-and-locally).

## Accessing your Ledger wallet

After launching the MyCrypto desktop application on your computer, you can connect your Ledger device to your computer and [access your Ledger wallet](/how-to/migrating/moving-from-mycrypto-to-ledger).
