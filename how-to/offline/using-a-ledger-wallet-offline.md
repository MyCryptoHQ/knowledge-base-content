<Alert label="The desktop application is not actively maintained.">

The MyCrypto desktop application is part of an older version of MyCrypto that is not actively maintained. You can find the latest version of MyCrypto on [mycrypto.com](https://mycrypto.com/).

</Alert>

Storing your ETH, tokens, ETC, BTC and many other cryptocurrencies on a [hardware wallet](/staying-safe/hardware-wallet-recommendations) like the Ledger wallet is one of the safest and easiest ways to store your coins. Though the keys are stored on the device itself, you can increase your security by accessing your Ledger wallet offline. This reduces various risks, like [phishing attacks](/staying-safe/common-scams/common-scams-overview).

## Downloading the MyCrypto desktop application

To be able to run MyCrypto offline, you will have to install the latest version of the MyCrypto desktop application. This will allow you to access your Ledger device locally, both online and offline. You can find our guide on downloading & running MyCrypto locally [here](/how-to/offline/how-to-run-mycrypto-offline-and-locally).

## Accessing your Ledger wallet

After launching the MyCrypto desktop application on your computer, you can connect your Ledger device to your computer and [access your Ledger wallet](/how-to/migrating/moving-from-mycrypto-to-ledger). Be sure to follow our guide on [how to make an offline transaction](/how-to/sending/how-to-make-an-offline-transaction), which explains how to generate an offline transaction in greater detail.
