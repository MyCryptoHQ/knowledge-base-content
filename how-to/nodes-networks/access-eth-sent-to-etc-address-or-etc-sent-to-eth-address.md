In order to see your ETC and interact with the ETC chain, you must first be on an ETC node.

1. Select "ETC (AUTO)" in the network-switcher in the top-right corner of [https://mycrypto.com/account](https://mycrypto.com/account)
2. Unlock your wallet to send ETC to interact with the ETC chain.
3. You can see your ETC balance by clicking the "View & Send" page in the navigation and selected -> "View Address". You can also [check your balance](/how-to/accessing-wallet/how-to-check-the-balance-of-your-account) on a blockchain explorer.

In order to switch back to ETH, simply change the node back to an ETH node in the upper right corner.

## When it involves a hardware wallet...

1. Select "ETC (ETH)" in the network-switcher in the top-right corner of [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/account).
2. Connect to your hardware wallet like normal
3. Check the "Addresses" dropdown at the top of the pop-up. Change it to `TREZOR (ETH)` or `LEDGER (ETH)`
4. Look for your balance and select the address where your ETH or ETC are.

There are four possible combinations of network + path when it comes to hardware wallets. If the above doesn't show your balance, try all four:

* ETH Network, ETH path
* ETH Network, ETC path
* ETC Network, ETH path
* ETC Network, ETC path
