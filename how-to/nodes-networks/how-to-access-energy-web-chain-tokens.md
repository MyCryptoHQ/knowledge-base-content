Energy Web Chain ("EWC") is a blockchain designed to be used for the energy sector. Its utility token is Energy Web Token ("EWT") and this article will explain how you can access these tokens using MyCrypto.

EWC is a separate network and blockchain from Ethereum and is not a token on the Ethereum blockchain. The term "token" may cause confusion, but keep in mind that EWT is separate from Ethereum.

## Accessing your Energy Web Tokens

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="Ledger">

To interact with EWT using your Ledger device, you have to use the EnergyWebChain app on your Ledger device, **not** the Ethereum app. If you do not have this app installed, you can use [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) to install it.

After accessing your Ledger device with MyCrypto, you will notice that a list of different addresses will show up instead of the addresses that you would see if you were connected to the Ethereum network. You are free to use these for your Energy Web Tokens.

If you have accidentally sent EWT to your Ethereum addresses previously, you can still access these by clicking the drop-down field next to "Addresses" and selecting the "Ledger (ETH)" option.

You will see your Ethereum addresses displayed alongside their EWT funds.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="Trezor">

Access your Trezor device like usual. You will notice that a list of different addresses will show up, instead of the addresses that you would see if you were connected to the Ethereum network. You are free to use these for your Energy Web Tokens.

If you have accidentally sent EWT to your Ethereum addresses previously, you can still access these by clicking the drop-down field next to "Addresses" and selecting the "TREZOR (ETH)" option.

<Alert>

The MyCrypto desktop application is part of an older version of MyCrypto that is not actively maintained. You can find the latest version of MyCrypto on [mycrypto.com](https://mycrypto.com/).

</Alert>

You can access your address like usual and you'll be able to see your EWT right away. Note that you have to be connected to the EWT network when using the legacy MyCrypto desktop application.

From here, you are free to interact with your EWT however you wish.

## Accessing your EWTB (Bridged) tokens

Energy Web has developed the EWT Bridged (EWTB) token, which is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. You can mint EWTB tokens through its interface which you can find at [bridge.energyweb.org](https://bridge.energyweb.org). This method allows you to transfer EWT from the Energy Web Chain to the Ethereum blockchain.

If your Ethereum address contains EWTB tokens, you might not see them in your interface right away. In this case, you have to manually add this token as a [custom token](/how-to/tokens/how-to-add-a-custom-token).

The contract address of EWTB is `0x178c820f862b14f316509ec36b13123da19a6054`, you can also find this address on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0x178c820f862b14f316509ec36b13123da19a6054).

After adding this token to your interface, you will be able to see your EWTB and interact with it however you wish. Do keep in mind that you have to be connected to the Ethereum network in order to view and send them.
