All you need is the 24 seed words that you wrote down when you first initially setup the Trezor. You can use the words on MyCrypto to recover your crypto and tokens.

If you used any passphrases on the Trezor and used any crypto or tokens with a passphrase protected wallet, then you will also need the relevant passphrase.

Do not store these recovery words on your computer, as it will be just as unsafe as using a normal private key. Always physically write it down using a pen and a piece of paper that only you have access to. Also, do not take a photo of your piece of paper.
