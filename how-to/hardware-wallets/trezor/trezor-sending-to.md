To send funds to your Trezor device, you simply need to connect it to MyCrypto, and select one of the addresses that show up. These addresses are stored on your Trezor device, and can be used for receiving Ether and ERC-20 tokens.

Use one of these addresses as the destination address when you send your ETH from other wallets / exchanges.
