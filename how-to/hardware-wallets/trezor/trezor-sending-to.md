Here is how you can get your address to send to your Trezor:

1. Go to [https://mycrypto.com/account](https://mycrypto.com/account).
2. To send ETH, check to make sure you are using an Ethereum node by looking at the Network Switcher in the top-right corner.
3. Then, select `TREZOR` from the list of wallet types.
4. Select `Connect to TREZOR`.
5. Unlock your Trezor with PIN (and passphrase if you have it).
6. A list of addresses will show up. These are your ETH addresses that your Trezor manages. Choose one from the list, preferably on the first page so you don't have to go searching later.
7. Use one of these as the destination address when you send your ETH from other wallets / exchanges.
