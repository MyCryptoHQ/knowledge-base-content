3. If you would like to load that token each time you visit [MyCrypto.com](https://beta.mycrypto.com/account), check the box next to the token and press "Save."

4. If a token you would like to see or send is not showing up, you will need to add it as a custom token. Click [here](/troubleshooting/tokens/adding-new-token-and-sending-custom-tokens) for instructions on how to add a token.

5. If you have a balance, you won't have to load it againâ€”it will automatically load in the future! Yay!
