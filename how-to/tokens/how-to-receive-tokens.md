## How to receive ERC20 tokens

You can receive any ERC20 token by simply sending it to **your** Ethereum address (that´s the one starting with "0x....").

If the token is not in our default token list, you will need to [add it as a custom token first](https://support.mycrypto.com/tokens/adding-new-token-and-sending-custom-tokens.html).

#### Please do NOT send your tokens to the token contract address, or you might lose them forever.
