## How to receive ERC-20 tokens

You can receive any ERC20 token by simply sending it to **your** Ethereum address (thatÂ´s the one starting with "0x....").

If the token is not in our default token list, you will need to [add it as a custom token first](/troubleshooting/tokens/adding-new-token-and-sending-custom-tokens).

Please do **NOT** send your tokens to the token contract address, or you will lose them forever.
