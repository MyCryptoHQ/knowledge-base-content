It is very easy to use your mobile wallet in conjunction with the functionality of MyCrypto. Many of the most widely used mobile wallets allow you to connect to web3 applications quickly and easily by using WalletConnect. Itâ€™s as simple as scanning a QR code with your phone.

First, you need to add your account to MyCrypto. On the add account screen, select WalletConnect, and the Ethereum network. Once you do this, it will display a QR code. Depending on which mobile wallet you are using, you either just scan the code the same way you would for any other mobile transaction, or check inside your settings for a WalletConnect option.

## How to connect using different mobile apps

These are just a couple of the available apps that support WalletConnect. If you're not using one of the apps mentioned here, you can still use WalletConnect with MyCrypto.
