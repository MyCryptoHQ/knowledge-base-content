### Mist & Geth

Mist files are typically found in the file locations below but it's much easier to open Mist, select "Accounts" in the top bar, select "Backup," and select "Accounts." This will open the folder where your files are stored.

*   Mac:`~/Library/Ethereum/keystore`
*   Linux:`~/.ethereum/keystore`
*   Windows:`%APPDATA%/Ethereum/keystore`

Command-line options:
```
--keystore
  Directory for the keystore (default = inside the datadir)

```


### Presale

Wherever you saved it. ;)

It also was emailed to you, so check your email inbox and any older email addresses you may have had.

Search for the file called "`ethereum_wallet_backup.json`." This wallet file will be encrypted with a password that you created when you made your presale purchase.

Hopefully, you will find the file and can access it.
