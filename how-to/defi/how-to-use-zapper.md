## More Information About Zapper

Zaps are created by none other than [Zapper](https://zapper.fi) (formerly known as DeFiZap)! With the intent to help users gain access to decentralized finance (“DeFi”) protocols, Zapper takes complicated processes and turns them into one-click solutions.

In addition to this easy entry into otherwise complicated DeFi protocols, it’s all noncustodial. You retain complete control of your funds and can manage everything manually if you’d like.

MyCrypto’s Zapper integration aims to take this one step further and allows one-step access to DeFi protocols without having to leave the comfort of your dashboard.

Visit [Zapper](https://zapper.fi) to learn more.

## How To Enter A Zap

Upon visiting your MyCrypto dashboard, there’s an area for Zapper. You’ll see a summary of the available zaps, how they work, and your balances.
