MyCrypto supports `ETH`, `ETC`, all testnet networks (Ropsten, Kovan, Rinkeby), any other Ethereum-based network (`EWT`, `UBQ`, `EXP`, `POA` etc.), and any Ethereum Standard Tokens - also known as "ERC-20" tokens.

You can use [Shapeshift.io](https://shapeshift.io/) or another exchange to swap ,convert, or exchange your other coins into ETH or Ethereum tokens. However, you do not send those other coins directly to your Ethereum address.

We recommend [Exodus.io](https://www.exodus.io/) as a client-side, multi-coin solution.

MyCrypto supports a lot of ERC-20 tokens by default, however, any missing ERC-20 token can easily be added to your local interface by following [these instructions](/how-to/tokens/showing-and-loading-tokens).
