There is no minimum to transfer as MyCrypto is not an exchange and has no way of blocking your withdrawals or deposits.

The minimum is the minimum amount of gas needed to complete the transaction. For a standard transaction, that is 21,000 units of gas.

If you have 0.00...1 ETH in your account and want to empty your account completely, send 0.01 ETH into the account and then use the "Send Entire Balance" button to send the entire balance out. This will leave you with a balance of 0.
