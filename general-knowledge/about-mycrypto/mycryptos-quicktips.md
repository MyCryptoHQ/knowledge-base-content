1. Hardware wallets ensure your key isn't vulnerable to phishers. Order a [TREZOR](https://shop.trezor.io/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/?utm_source=&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1985&utm_content=) or [KeepKey](https://www.keepkey.com/?source=hasoffers) today!
2. The EtherSecurityLookup Chrome Extension warns you if you go to a malicious site: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ethersecuritylookup/bhhfhgpgmifehjdghlbbijjaimhmcgnf](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ethersecuritylookup/bhhfhgpgmifehjdghlbbijjaimhmcgnf)
3. [The MyCrypto Philosophy] Education is Key: Ethereum, security, privacy, importance of controlling your keys & how the blockchain works
4. [The MyCrypto Philosophy] Empower the people: Give people the ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain without having to run a full node
5. [The MyCrypto Philosophy] If it can be hacked, it will be hacked: Never save, store, or transmit passwords or keys
6. [The MyCrypto Philosophy] Make it easy & free: Everyone should be able to create an account and send Ether & Tokens
7. [The MyCrypto Philosophy] People are the Priority: You are the most important. If monetization leads to a worse user experience, we don't do it
8. [The MyCrypto Philosophy] Private: No tracking, ads, demographics! We don't know who you are, what you do on our site, nor where you are
9. Always check that you are on the correct URL. (e.g. mycrypto.com)
10. Always double-check what you are sending, how much you are sending & what address you are sending to.
11. Back up your key in a separate location BEFORE sending ETH/Tokens to it
12. Be VERY careful entering your private key on ANY site
13. Before sending to a third-party or using a new service, always Google the service name + "scam" or "reviews"
14. Bookmark your crypto sites. Use those bookmarks and only those.
15. Brain wallets (where you choose the seed) are not secure. Human brains cannot generate entropy. Don't use brain wallets
16. Do not ever run remote-access software (e.g. TeamViewer)
17. Do not trust addresses or URLs. Always verify information w/ a secondary source
18. Do not trust any address except the one posted on the official site
19. Do you know another language? Help keep MyCrypto translations up to date! [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4z55s2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4z55s2)
20. Don't click on links from Slackbots or Slack DMs
21. Don't ever trade / buy / sell ETH via Paypal. They can file a dispute and take your money 90 days later
22. Don't trust DMs or Emails. We will never DM you or email except in response to you
23. Don't enter your private key to check your balance. Use [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/)

27. Follow us on Twitter for important alerts: [https://twitter.com/mycrypto](https://twitter.com/mycrypto)
28. For new accounts, especially cold storage, send small amount in & out
29. [https://ethplorer.io/ allows you to easily see token balances and transfers](https://ethplorer.io/) allows you to easily see token balances and transfers

31. If you have accidentally visited or typed a malicious site, clean out your recent history and autocomplete

33. Install an adblocker that actually turns off Google/Bing Ads
34. Keystore File (UTC / JSON): This is encrypted by your password. It matches the format used by Mist so you can easily import it in the future
35. MyCrypto is client-side / serverless. We are 100% open source & audit-able by all
36. MyCrypto supports viewing & sending all ERC-20 Tokens. You can add them yourself
37. Mnemonic Phrases derive an infinite number of addresses & private keys

39. Never enter your private keys, passwords, sensitive data on a website that you were sent via message
40. Never hand type your private key / keystore file. Double-check the words for mnemonic keys if hand typing
41. Never hand-type your address. (If you mistype, your ETH could be lost forever!)
42. Never invest more than you are willing to lose, then you can enjoy the ride ?
43. No one is giving you free or discounted ETH. Even for completing a survey
44. ONLY unlock your wallet when you want to send a transaction
45. Our helpers page is full of nifty helpers, like WEI <-> ETH converter and debugging ENS reveals! [https://legacy.mycrypto.com/helpers.html](https://legacy.mycrypto.com/helpers.html)
46. Phishers try to trick you with scary messages. Don't fall for them
47. Private Key (unencrypted): The unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no PW is necessary. Keep it *offline*, like on *paper*!
48. Pro-tip: When asking for help, be nice. Grouchy-pants get helped slower than a 1 GWEI TX on a token sale day. ??
49. See what gas price you should use at [http://ethgasstation.info](http://ethgasstation.info)
50. Send a test transaction first & make sure it arrives at intended destination before sending all the ETH
51. Store backups of you Keystore file version & paper wallet in physically separate, offline environments
52. The best passwords are strong & easy to remember. If you store your password with your keystore file, it's pretty much useless
53. The TX fee = gas price * gas limit & is paid to miners for including your TX in a block. Higher gas price = faster TX, but more expensive
54. Turn on 2FA for *everything* today. Go do it. Right now
55. Use the version of your address that has uppercase letters. It has a checksum
