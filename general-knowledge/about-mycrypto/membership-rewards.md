## Requesting MyCrypto Membership Rewards

To receive your **Membership Badge & NFT**, all you have to do is purchase the membership. The NFT is then delivered directly into your account and you'll be able to view it on your [NFT Dashboard](https://app.mycrypto.com/nft-dashboard?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=support&utm_campaign=membership) or on another site like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io).

### MyCrypto Stickers

**To request your MyCrypto Stickers**, send an email to [membership@mycrypto.com](mailto:membership@mycrypto.com) with the following:

- Subject line: **Sticker Request - MyCrypto Member**

- Include the following in the body of your email:
  - The ETH address that holds your Membership Token (so we can verify)
  - Your name or alias
  - Your mailing address

Click [here](mailto:membership@mycrypto.com?subject=Sticker%20Request%20-%20MyCrypto%20Member) to open an email prompt with the address and subject line pre-filled.

### Regular POAP NFT drops

All active memberships result in being able to claim the POAPs for the active duration of that membership. (If a POAP drops while your membership is active, youâ€™re good to go)

Some POAP drops will be sent directly to your account, others will need to be claimed manually. Keep an eye on the [MyCrypto Discord](https://discord.gg/VSaTXEA) for more info about these.

If you purchase a year or lifetime membership, you can also request previous POAPs that you missed. To do this, send an email to [membership@mycrypto.com](mailto:membership@mycrypto.com) with the following:

- Subject line: **POAP Request - MyCrypto Member**

- Include the following in the body of your email:
  - The ETH address that holds your Membership Token (so we can verify)
  - The POAP youâ€™d like to request

Click [here](mailto:membership@mycrypto.com?subject=POAP%20Request%20-%20MyCrypto%20Member) to open an email prompt with the address and subject line pre-filled.

_A note regarding POAPs: Sometimes we give out POAPs on the MyCrypto Dashboard for the community. Due to our method for sybil resistance (so users can't claim more than one POAP), we are unable to give out these POAP codes to users who have "Product Analytics" turned off in their MyCrypto Settings._

### 10% Discount for Trezor Hardware Wallets

MyCrypto Membership holders will receive a special 10% discount on Trezor purchases -- thatâ€™s worth $20 off if you get a Trezor Model T!

To request your 10% discount code, please send an email to [membership@mycrypto.com](mailto:membership@mycrypto.com) with the following:

- Subject line: **Trezor Discount Request - MyCrypto Member**

- Include the following in the body of your email:
  - The ETH address that holds your Membership Token (so we can verify)

Click [here](mailto:membership@mycrypto.com?subject=Trezor%20Discount%20Request%20-%20MyCrypto%20Member) to open an email prompt with the address and subject line pre-filled.

### Extra Faucet Testnet ETH

[MyCryptoâ€™s faucet](https://app.mycrypto.com/faucet?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=support&utm_campaign=membership) for Rinkeby, Ropsten, Kovan, and Goerli traditionally yields .1 ETH. MyCryptoâ€™s support team will fulfill requests for more, on a case by case basis, but purchasing a MyCrypto Membership will result in the ability to request more ETH.

If you hold an active MyCrypto Membership, you can request up to 5 testnet ETH per day as long as we have it available. To request this, send an email to [membership@mycrypto.com](mailto:membership@mycrypto.com) with the following:

- Subject line: **Testnet ETH Request - MyCrypto Member**

- Include the following in the body of your email:
  - The ETH address that holds your Membership Token (so we can verify)
  - The ETH address you'd like Testnet ETH to be sent to
  - The Testnet network you want that ETH for
  - How much ETH you need

These requests are handled manually for now but in the future we will automatically detect if you hold a membership and will increase your limit directly on the faucet.
