This is part of a series where Taylor pulls sweet comments she has made or found over the years in the hopes that they can be useful, searchable, remembered, referenced, and/or aid in creating the future knowledge base posts.

Ok so I'm bullish but I'l chime in with my  **FUD list of doom!** :)

### Technical risks

* CASPER POS is challenging and not 100% certain it will work.
* Scaling & sharding is challenging and not 100% certain it will work.
* Maybe despite being batshit crazy Paul Sztorc could be right that oracles are impossible
* Possible long term security holes of fundamental flaws might be discovered

### Resource & cashflow risk

* Foundation has limited funds.
* Key developers could be poached.
* Still not seeing evidence of significant VC investment.

### Competition risks

* R3 may win financial market
* Hyperledger may win IOT market
* Ripple could win international settlement & remittances market.
* Some anon coin may win the darknet market
* Could have a million ethereum alt coins indeed consensy could themselves fork Ethereum
* Bitcoin might finally sort out their politics
* Rootstock & counterparty
* Some new unknown coin could be a better ethereum than ethereum.

### Regulatory risks

* Goverments could clamp down on crypto exchanges
* Goverments could require permissioned system or back a rival system
* Goverments could clamp down on IPO or crowd shares
* Goverments could clamp down on issuance of assets or create more onerous KYC requirements

### Reputational risks

* If Kraken or Polonex is the new Mt Gox
* If some scam or pyramid scheme gives Dapps a bad name
* If a significant number of wallets are hacked
* If Ethereum community becomes as toxic as the bitcoin community

### Barriers to adoption

* It is hard to communicate what Ethereum is
* Press insists on using the term 'blockchain' or 'bitcoin'
* Ethereum PR sucks.
* It is still hard for 'normal people' to buy Ether and securely store it.
* There is not yet a killer app
* Maybe nobody actually wants Dapps or even crypto currency they just want an investment opportunity
* Even if there is a killer app the advantages of decentralisation are unclear
* Maybe noone actually cares about decentralisation apart from nutjob bitcoiners and they only care about bitcoin
* Still no major exchanges listing and hard to buy in directly from fiat
* Major Chinese exchanges may never add Eth because they make all their money from mining BTC so don't want Eth to succeed.

### Ethereum could succeed without Ether becoming valuable

* Stable coins, gold & other currencies will be used for payment & wealth storage not Eth.
* Eth will lose it's monopoly for buying gas
* Because of competition & scaling transaction fees will fall to the cost of operation & capital.

Although even with the above I still put us way above Ripple & even BTC.
