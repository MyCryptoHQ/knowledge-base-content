You do not need multiple wallets for every token sale. You can receive multiple ERC-20 tokens in a single address. If you wish to use multiple address, please note that you will need a small amount of ETH in order to transfer the tokens out.

If you are not able to see the token after the token sale has completed, you might have to [add it as a custom token](/how-to/tokens/showing-and-loading-tokens).
