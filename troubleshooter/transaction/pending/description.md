At times, combinations of new users, increased interest, or popular DeFi products can create quite a mess of the transaction pool. This sometimes results in an accumulation of pending transactions that take longer than normal to send, and is a network issue that affects all exchanges and clients.

It's possible to [speed up a transaction](/how-to/sending/how-to-speed-up-a-transaction) right from your MyCrypto interface by [checking the status of your transaction](/how-to/sending/checking-the-status-of-a-transaction), and clicking the "Speed up transaction" button.
