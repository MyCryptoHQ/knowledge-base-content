Networks that are supported by MyCrypto have their own native asset, but might also support tokens that are based on that network. A network has one native asset, but might support a large amount of different tokens.

An example of a native asset would be ETH in the context of Ethereum. Tokens on the Ethereum network are often referred to as ERC-20 tokens, of which DAI would be an example of.

What type of issue are you experiencing?
