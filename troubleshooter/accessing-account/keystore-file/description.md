Using keystore files is not recommended, as they are [insecure](https://medium.com/mycrypto/a-safer-mycrypto-79d65196e7d8). If you were to access your account on a phishing site with a private key, the phishers would get full access to your wallet. However, if you still desire to create and use a wallet in this manner, you can generate them locally with the [MyCrypto Desktop App](https://download.mycrypto.com/).
