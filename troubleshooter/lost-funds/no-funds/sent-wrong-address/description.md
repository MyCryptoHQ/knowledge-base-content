In the event you've accidentally sent funds to a wrong address that doesn't belong to you, it might be rather difficult, or possibly impossible to get it back.

First thing is to find out who the address belongs to. Try to look up the address on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), and see if there are any other transfers going to or out of that address, or if it shows any label.

If you sent your funds to an address belonging to an exchange, there's a chance they're willing to help you out. Often times, exchanges are willing to do this for free, but some might ask for a small fee to be deducted from the amount they will send back.

As all transactions on the blockchain are final, it's not possible for MyCrypto to return or refund any transactions. Only the owner of the address you've sent funds to will be able to send these back.
