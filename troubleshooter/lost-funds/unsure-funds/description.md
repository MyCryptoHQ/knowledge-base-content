When your secrets get compromised, bad actors will often put a [sweeper on your account](https://blog.mycrypto.com/how-to-beat-an-ethereum-based-sweeper-and-recover-your-assets/) to take advantage of anything that happens to the address in the future — either you deposit ETH to try and save some tokens, an airdrop happens, or something else.

If you believe there might be a sweeper on your account, we can assist you in the rescuing of funds for a gratuity of 10% (minimum $250) of the rescued funds. We would like to offer this for free to everyone, but we've received a massive influx of requests for help and our time is already thin as it is. Any proceeds from this service go towards us trying to make this industry a better and safer place!

Even if you're unsure whether you have any stuck funds in your account, you're free to reach out to us so we can take a closer look.

If you'd like to move forward with this service, please reach out to [support@mycrypto.com](mailto:support@mycrypto.com?subject=Account%20Sweeper%20-%20Requesting%20Assistance!) with the subject line **"Account Sweeper - Requesting Assistance!"**

_The above email is the ONLY ROUTE for requesting help with this. We will NOT discuss this in Telegram, Discord, nor anywhere else as the additional risk of getting scammed is too high._
