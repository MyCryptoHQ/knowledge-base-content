MyCrypto is not a "web wallet." You do not create an account or give us your ETH or tokens to hold on to. We are simply an interface that allows you to easily interact with cryptocurrency.

In order to ensure your security and privacy, no sensitive data is ever saved, stored, or transmitted when you use MyCrypto. We only have access to the information that is publicly available on the blockchain.

Unfortunately, this means we cannot:

* Reverse or cancel transactions
* Access your account
* Recover your account
* Send your crypto or tokens from one address to another
* Recover your private key
* Recover or reset your password

If the account you sent to belongs to another party, such as an individual or an exchange, you should try and reach out to them to find out whether you can recover your funds. You can determine whether the account in use by searching it on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) and seeing if there are any other incoming or outgoing transactions.
