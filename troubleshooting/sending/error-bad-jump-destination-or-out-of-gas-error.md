> My transaction has a `Bad jump destination` or `Out of Gas` error. When do I get my ETH back?

When a transaction fails due to a `Bad jump destination` or `Out of Gas` error, the ETH never actually leaves your account. If you check your balance on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), [Ethplorer](https://ethplorer.io/), or MyCrypto, you should see the same amount you had before.

There are a lot of complicated things about gas and transactions, especially during ICO-times, but luckily [we have a pretty sweet write-up that should help clarify things](/general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/what-is-gas).
