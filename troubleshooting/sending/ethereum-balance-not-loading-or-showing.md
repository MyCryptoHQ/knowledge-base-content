This is most likely due to the fact that either you are behind a firewall, or our nodes are under extreme strain and are refusing to return your balance information.

Try to perform a hard refresh on the page. On Chrome on OSX, you hit `Command` + `Shift` + `R`. On Windows or other machines, it's `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `R`.

Additionally, as your balance is publicly available on the Ethereum blockchain, you can always paste your address into the search bar on either [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) or [Etherchain](https://www.etherchain.org/) and it will pull up your balance and transaction history.
