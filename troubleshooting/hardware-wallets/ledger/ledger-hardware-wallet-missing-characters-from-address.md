This is fixed when updating the ETH application from Ledger Manager. You can learn how to do this by following  [this guide](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113).

If that doesn't fix the issue, you may need to delete the application and install it again.

Before you update or delete the application, **ensure you have properly backed up the 24-word recovery phrase for your Ledger and have it handy in case you need it**. Usually you do not need the recovery phrase when updating or deleting an application.
