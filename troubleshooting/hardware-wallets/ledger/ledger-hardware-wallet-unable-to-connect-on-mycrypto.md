Your Ledger Hardware Wallet can be finicky at times. Here are some troubleshooting tips that should help solve most of the common issues when connecting to a Ledger.

- Make sure that your Ledger firmware is fully up to date by using [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live). Read the [instructions for Nano X](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013349800-Update-Ledger-Nano-X-firmware), or [instructions for Nano S](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113-Update-Ledger-Nano-S-firmware).
- Try unplugging your Ledger device, then plugging it back in.
- Restart your computer.
- Try a different USB cable.
- Try a different USB port.
- Try a different computer.
- Make sure you don't have any other apps open that connect to your Ledger (e.g., Ledger Live, Mist, etc.).
- Make sure that you are confirming any transactions via your Ledger.
- If you are using Linux and Ledger, [you may need to add udev rules](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues) (under Linux section, scroll down).

You can find additional instructions per operating system on [Ledger's support page](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues).
