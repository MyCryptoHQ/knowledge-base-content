In order to send data (e.g., when sending tokens) with your transaction via your Ledger Nano S or Ledger Blue, you need to enable "contract data" on your Ledger device. If you do not, you will receive the error "Invalid status 6a80." To enable this setting:

* On your device, open theÂ Ethereum application
* Enable the "Contract data" setting
