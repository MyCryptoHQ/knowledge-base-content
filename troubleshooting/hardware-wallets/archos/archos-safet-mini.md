Below is a guide on how to use the Archos Safe-T Mini Hardware Wallet with MyCrypto. We strongly recommend getting a hardware wallet to store your Ether and / or ERC-20 tokens. Please note that this guide assumes that your device is already configured. If not, please visit the [Archos Safe-T Mini FAQ Section](https://www.archos.com/gb/products/crypto/faq.html) for more information and to view a video on how to "Configure your Safe-T Mini."

## Getting Started

To send and receive Ether, please connect to [safe-t.io](https://safe-t.io/).

Different Ethereum addresses are displayed. All of these addresses are accessible via your Safe-T Mini. Select the address you want to use for your transaction.

MyCrypto is now connected to your Safe-T Mini!

## Receiving Ether or Tokens

Go to “Request payment.”

Your receiving address is now displayed in the “To Address” box, and also on the right side of the screen. This is the address you use to receive Ether.

Gas fees validate the transaction. We recommend not changing the gas limit.

For security reasons, we also recommend you click on the “Display address on Safe-T mini” section. It will display your receiving address and your QR code on your Safe-T mini so you can check that they are the same as on your computer screen.

## Sending Ether or Tokens

Click on “Send Ether & Tokens.” The following page will open:

Enter the recipient's address and the amount you would like to send. It is recommended to send a smaller test transaction before you send higher amounts.

You’ll need to adjust the “Transaction fee” bar. The more you pay, the quicker your transaction will be validated. We recommend setting the “fee” bar to the middle.

When clicking on “Send,” you’ll have to validate the transaction on your computer and on your Safe-T Mini.

Make sure to check the information displayed on your Safe-T mini because that information can’t be hacked, though your computer and its screen can. What your computer screen displays is not 100% safe!

## Wallet Info

Click on “Wallet info.”

This displays the address and the QR code of the wallet you are using.

You can click “Display address on Safe-T mini” to check that the information is the same as displayed on your Safe-T Mini.

## Recent Transactions

By clicking on “Recent transaction,” the history of your transactions is displayed.

**Note**: MyCrypto can also be used to send and receive Ethereum Classic and ERC-20 tokens.
