Sometimes your Trezor hardware wallet won't connect to MyCrypto. Here are some troubleshooting tips to try:

* Use [MyCrypto.com](https://mycrypto.com/) (if you were using the desktop application)
* Use the [MyCrypto desktop application](https://download.mycrypto.com/)
* Update your Trezor firmware
* Try a different USB cable
* Try a different USB port
* Try restarting your computer
* Check to make sure you are taking required actions in pop ups or new tabs

If none of these work, please contact us and we will try our best to help you out.
