> I keep getting a message saying "Window Blocked" before confirming my transaction.

When connecting to your TREZOR device, you need to ALLOW POP-UPS on MyCrypto.com.

This allows information to safely be sent to your TREZOR device so that the device can sign the transaction and you can safely send the transaction via our infrastructure.
