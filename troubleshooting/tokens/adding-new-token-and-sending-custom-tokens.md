## How to add a new ERC-20 token

If you can't see a token when you access your wallet on MyCrypto, you simply just need to add it to your interface in order to see it and then send it in a transaction.

Any ERC-20 token can be added to your local MyCrypto interface by following these instructions.

1. After accessing your address, click the "Scan For Tokens" button.

2. Your tokens should appear if the token is on our token list. If you have a balance, you won't have to load it again â€” it will automatically load in the future.

If your token is not on the list, click the "Add Custom Token" button which will bring up the fields below.

You can use Ethplorer or Etherscan to find out the parameters of your token. 

If there is an issue with adding a custom token, try adding it again but suffixing the name with `-1`. For example `TOK` becomes `TOK-1`.

### via [Ethplorer](https://ethplorer.io/)Â 

1. OnÂ the ["Send"](https://mycrypto.com/account) page on MyCrypto, click `View Address` and paste *your* address.

2. In a new tab, go toÂ [Ethplorer.io](https://ethplorer.io/).Â

5. Click on the token that you want to add from the tokens shown in your wallet.

### Removing a custom token

To remove a custom token, click the little ( - ) icon next to the token. This will remove it from the interface. It will not delete or remove the token from the wallet itself. They are still safely stored in your wallet, we promise.
