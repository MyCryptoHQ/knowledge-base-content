When you scan for tokens in your MyCrypto interface, not every token might show up right away. This is because MyCrypto keeps a list of tokens to scan for, and it's possible that the token you're looking for is not on the list yet.

For your token to show up, you can manually add it as a custom token, by following the instructions [here](/how-to/tokens/how-to-add-a-custom-token).
