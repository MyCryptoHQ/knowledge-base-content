## <center>How to Fix Accidentally Inputting Incorrect Custom Token Details</center>

#### "I added a token, but it is a `Not a valid ERC-20 token`?"
A `Not a valid ERC-20 token` error can occur when an incorrect contract address was added as a custom token. 

#### "I added a token, but I have 0 balance?"
Be sure to use the correct contract address, not adding the correct contract address will show that you own 0 of the tokens you are trying to add. 

#### "I added a token, I'm suppose to have 25.57 tokens but it shows 0.002557"
This happens when you input an incorrect decimal value while entering custom token details. 

To fix these errors please remove the token from your MyCrypto Interface and re-add the token. To remove a custom token, click the little `( - )` icon next to token you wish to re-add. This will remove it from the interface. It is not deleting or removing the tokens from your wallet, they are still safely in your wallet, we promise.

#### Please follow our guide on how to add a token for further guidance. [Adding Custom Ethereum (ERC-20) Tokens](https://support.mycrypto.com/tokens/adding-new-token-and-sending-custom-tokens.html)
