Be sure there is no space at the beginning or end of your private key. MyCrypto validates based on the number of characters. If you saved another version (for example, the [UTC / Keystore file](/how-to/accessing-wallet/how-to-access-your-wallet-with-keystore-file)) it may be worth trying that file as well.

Please be sure that you are **carefully and accurately** entering your private key. A single wrong character will open a different wallet than "yours," and will show a zero balance.

An example of a valid private key looks like this: `afdfd9c3d2095ef696594f6cedcae59e72dcd697e2a7521b1578140422a4f890`

Do not use the above example private key, and never share your own with others. If you share your private key with anyone, they will have full control over your address, and its funds.
