Sample error message: *"Your Ledger is currently in use with another application. Please wait, or close other wallet applications before trying again."*

**Please try the following. This solves 99% of problems.**

* If you are using MyCrypto.com + Ledger hardware wallet, make sure you have browser support turned ON. (This option is on the Ledger device itself under Settings.)
* If you are using the MyCrypto desktop application + Ledger hardware wallet, make sure browser support is turned OFF. (This option is on the Ledger device itself under Settings.)
* Restart your computer.
* Try unplugging your hardware wallet and plugging it back in.
* Try a different USB cable.
* UseÂ Google Chrome.
* Use the [MyCrypto Desktop App](https://download.mycrypto.com/).
* Make sure you don't have any other apps open that connect to your Ledger (e.g., the Ledger Bitcoin Chrome app, Mist, etc.).
* Make sure that you are confirming any transactions via your Ledger.
* If you are using Linux and Ledger Nano, you may need to add udev rules as explained [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues) (under Linux section, scroll down).
