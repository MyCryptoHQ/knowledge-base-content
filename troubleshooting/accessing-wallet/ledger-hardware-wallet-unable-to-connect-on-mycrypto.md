Your Ledger Hardware Wallet can be finicky at times. Here are some troubleshooting tips that should help solve most of the common issues when connecting to a Ledger.

* Update your Ledger Firmware. [Ledger Firmware Update](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113-Update-device-firmware).
* Restart your computer.
* Try unplugging and replugging your hardware wallet.
* Try a different USB cable.
* Try a different USB port.
* Try a different computer.
* Try using Google Chrome, Opera, or Brave.
* Use the [MyCrypto Desktop App](https://download.mycrypto.com/).
* Make sure you don't have any other apps open that connect to your Ledger (e.g., Ledger Live, Mist, etc.).
* Make sure that you are confirming any transactions via your Ledger.
* If you are using Linux and Ledger, you may need to add udev rules as explained [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues) (under Linux section, scroll down).
