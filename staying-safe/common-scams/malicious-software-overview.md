Malicious software is anything that changes the functionality of your computer for the purpose of making someone else profit in some way. Malicious software can come in many forms, from [Keyloggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging) to [Clipboard Hijackers](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/clipboard-hijack-attack) to [RATs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_access_trojan) and [Trojans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)).

This malware can be used to steal your funds by taking your private keys (the access key to your public address) and transferring your funds away.

## How can I mitigate this?

To mitigate this, users should always practice safe computing habits. Here are some useful tips:

* Do not download files from e-mail or websites that you don't know or trust.
* Get in the habit of running periodic antivirus/antimalware scans on your computer.
* Do not use public networks for anything related to cryptocurrency. Public networks expose your browsing habits to anyone on the network listening for them.
* Download an antivirus and firewall software for your computer.
* Do not allow others to have unmonitored access to your computer.

## Keyloggers

Keyloggers can be used to record your private keys/keystore passwords/mnemonic phrases.

## Clipboard Hijackers

Clipboard Hijackers can be used to for public key replacement which is an attack in which a bad actor's malware watches your clipboard and when it sees strings that resemble Ethereum, Bitcoin, Monero, or Litecoin public keys, it replaces the copied public key with their own, previously-specified public key. That way, when you go to paste it into a send box to send your funds to someone or some organization, you actually end up sending to the attacker.
