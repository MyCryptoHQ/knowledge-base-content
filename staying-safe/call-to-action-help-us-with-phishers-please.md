**These phishers will not stop until they stop getting money or get caught.** We don't have the time or manpower to do it all. There are so many things to do and watch and document. We thank you for your help.

## 1. Educate when you see a message

- If you see a link to one of these sites or a fake token sale address, comment on it on Twitter or on Reddit or wherever. Warn people QUICKLY & LOUDLY.

> "There are scammers that are DMing, posting links, posting comments, and trying to get you to navigate to fake URLs. DO NOT CLICK THEM!" (Yes. People still don't know this.)
>
> Remind people: "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is."
>
> âš  PSA! Do NOT click the link or listen to the scammer! That is a phishing site. Always check your URL and / or consider getting a Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet.

## 2. Educate _before_ you see a message

Help spread the word: Private keys are _private_. Use hardware wallets. Use cold storage. Go offline. Check URLs.

- [Creating a wallet offline](/how-to/offline/how-to-run-mycrypto-offline-and-locally) is good.
- Getting a [Ledger or Trezor Hardware Wallet](/staying-safe/hardware-wallet-recommendations) is even better.
- [You can sign transactions offline so your key never touches a phishing site!](/how-to/sending/how-to-make-an-offline-transaction)
- Install EtherAddressLookup to block malicious / phishing sites: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn).
- Install MetaMask to block malicious / phishing sites and interact with MyCrypto: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn).
- Never enter your private keys, passwords, or sensitive data on a website that you were sent via a message.
- Do not trust messages, addresses, or URLs sent via private message. Always verify information with a secondary source.

> I am writing to you today to report a malicious website on your service: `insert_domain_here`. This website is posing as the legitimate site `mycrypto.com`. The operators of this malicious phishing website site ( `insert_domain_here_again` ) have added code that steals the private keys of unsuspecting users, and sends them insecurely to their own servers in order to steal the users' money. Please stop providing your service to ( `insert_domain_here_again` ) immediately to prevent further theft and protect users. Thank you.
