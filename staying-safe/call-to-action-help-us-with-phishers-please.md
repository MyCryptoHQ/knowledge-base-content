**These phishers will not stop until they stop getting money or get caught.** We don't have the time or manpower to do it all. There are so many things to do and watch and document. We thank you for your help.

### 1. Educate when you see a message

- If you see a link to one of these sites or a fake token sale address, comment on it on Twitter or on Reddit or wherever. Warn people QUICKLY & LOUDLY.

> "There are scammers that are DMing, posting links, posting comments, and trying to get you to navigate to fake URLs. DO NOT CLICK THEM!" (Yes. People still don't know this.)

> Remind people: "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is."

> ⚠ PSA! Do NOT click the link or listen to the scammer! That is a phishing site. Always check your URL and / or consider getting a Ledger or TREZOR hardware wallet.

### 2. Educate *before* you see a message

Help spread the word: Private keys are *private*. Use hardware wallets. Use cold storage. Go offline. Check URLs.

*   [Creating a wallet offline](https://support.mycrypto.com/offline/running-mycrypto-locally.html) is good.

*   Getting a [Ledger or TREZOR Hardware Wallet](https://support.mycrypto.com/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html) is even better.

*   [You can sign transactions offline so your key never touches a phishing site!](https://support.mycrypto.com/offline/making-offline-transaction-on-mycrypto.html)

- Install EtherSecurityLookup to block malicious tweets / tweeters: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ethersecuritylookup/bhhfhgpgmifehjdghlbbijjaimhmcgnf?hl=en-GB](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ethersecuritylookup/bhhfhgpgmifehjdghlbbijjaimhmcgnf?hl=en-GB).

- Install EtherAddressLookup to block malicious / phishing sites: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn).

- Install MetaMask to block malicious / phishing sites and interact with MyCrypto: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn).

*   Never enter your private keys, passwords, or sensitive data on a website that you were sent via a message.

*   ONLY unlock your wallet when you want to send a transaction. Check your balance via [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/) or [https://ethplorer.io/](https://ethplorer.io/).

*   Do not trust messages, addresses, or URLs sent via private message. Always verify information with a secondary source.
